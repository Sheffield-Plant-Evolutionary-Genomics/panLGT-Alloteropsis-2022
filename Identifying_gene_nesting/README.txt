## ID sister relationships

This process gene trees and idetifies the sister branch/clade to a query sequence, and then their combined sister branch/clade. It also reports the bootstrap values.


## Step 1: sister relation ships for all query sequences

to run the scrip

perl id_sister.pl Direcoty_of_gene_trees query_sequence_identifier

The clades are defined based on the sequence names within the perl script itself and is set up at present for use in this study. 


## Process results

The file 'tree_filtering_1.pl' contains a Perl script to filter out automatically no-LGT trees based on the table produced by the previous script.
